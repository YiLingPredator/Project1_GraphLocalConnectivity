Introduction to partitionWithEta
===============================
This repository including two branches: partition and partitionWithEta. 

The partionWithEta is based on newassignment3.pdf. It can do partition and relay node deployment. The difference between them is that the latter one don't need ci value. It only use partition result to get relaynode position.
1.Read the NodePosition.txt
2. Do the partition.
3. Using Matlab to run CVX_approx_exact.m which only use partition result and NodePosition to get the relaynode position.
